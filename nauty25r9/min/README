Aim: make a minimal and self-contained version of nauty

List of files
==============

nau0.h    standalone file

nau0s.h   simplified standalone file

naugeng.c uses in addition (only depends on nau0.h)
          geng.c, gtools.h, gtools.c


nau0.h and nau0s.h
===================

The symbolic links constitute a minimal subset of files.

The standalone file nau0.h or nau0s.h can be included by external programs to use the function nauty()


naugeng.c
=========

icc naugeng.c && ./a.out -C 4


naugeng.c
main()
  genextend()
    isbiconnected()
    accept1()/accept2()
      nauty()
      makecanon()

The function genextend() tries to build a graph
  by adding vertices to a smaller graph.

The functions accept1()/accept2() tests if the graph
  or its automorphism has appeared before
* accept1() works for nx < maxn
* accept2() works for nx == maxn

In the former case, the search continues.
