Aim: make a minimal and self-contained version of nauty

The symbolic links constitute a minimal subset of files.

The standalone file nau0.h or nau0s.h can be included by external programs to use the function nauty()

nau0.h    standalone file
nau0s.h   simplified standalone file

naugeng.c uses in addition
  geng.c
  gtools.h
  gtools.c

icc naugeng.c && ./a.out -C 4
